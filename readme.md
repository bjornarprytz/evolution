# Evolution

Roll dice

## Ideas

- Face opposite the "winning" face will be replaced each gen
- Equal (or non-equal) faces will partner up
- Face can have an extra effect

## TODO

### Game

- Game Loop
  - The player selects one from the remaining dice

- Nice to have
  - Die effects
  - Numbers beyond 1-6
  - Differentiate die "species"
